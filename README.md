Terraform practice repository covering basic DevOps use cases.
Includes hands-on work with Terraform providers (local, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm) and understanding of Terraform state and backend concepts.

The project was created for learning purposes and interview preparation.
Focus is on understanding how Terraform manages resources, providers, state, and backend behavior rather than building a full production setup.
